# Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

This project follows The Odin Project's Foundations course and is meant to refine DOM manipulation skills.

In this project, I aim to build a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch. In a 16x16 grid, a user can draw by hovering their mouse over the grid. The hovering of the mouse leaves a pixelated trail as a pen would on paper. There exists a button to clear the grid.
